# Task Management Automation

This project consists of a Spring Boot backend and a React frontend with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.

## Getting Started

### Backend (Spring Boot)

To run the backend, navigate to the `backend` directory and use Maven:

```bash
cd backend
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

The backend will be accessible at `http://localhost:8080`.

### Frontend (React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS)

To run the frontend, navigate to the `frontend` directory and use npm:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be accessible at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is in use).
